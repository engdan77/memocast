# Memocast

A small [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) application for e.g. iPhone that allow you to add links heard in podcasts into [reminders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminders_(Apple)).

## Motivation

Imagine that you just as I often do listening to a podcast such as [PythonBytes](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9weXRob25ieXRlcy5mbS9lcGlzb2Rlcy9yc3M/episode/NTI2OTQ0YjEtNDhjZS00OTllLWE3YTAtZThiZWU2MzdlMTMy?sa=X&ved=0CAwQz4EHahcKEwjgm5v-qov-AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCg) (a fantastic one) using [Google Podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/) while out walking and hear a talk about an interesting project or article you wish to read more about when time allow.
Thankfully the referenced links are added to the show notes of the talk, but it means you would need to look it up and add this into your own notes.

Wouldn't be nice if there was an easier way select which of those you found interesting and have them added to reminders on your phone while you'd still out walking without the need to lose too much focus on where you put your feets..?

... if you do recognise the same, then this small application might be what you're looking for.

## Requirements and installation

To allow Python to run within your device you will need to first to install [Pythonista 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097) from app store that by the time writing this costs $9.99 which to my opinion is a very small price for such useful addition to your device.
